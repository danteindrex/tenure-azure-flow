# Graph UI Display Issue - Resolution

## Problem
TypeError: The "data" argument must be of type string or an instance of Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView. Received undefined

This error occurred because Next.js was attempting to server-side render (SSR) the MembershipAnalytics component, which uses Chart.js. Chart.js is a browser-only library and cannot be serialized on the server.

## Root Cause
The MembershipAnalytics component was being imported statically:
```typescript
import MembershipAnalytics from '../components/MembershipAnalytics'
```

This caused Next.js to try to render the component on the server, leading to the undefined data error when attempting to serialize Chart.js components.

## Solution
Changed to dynamic import with SSR disabled:

```typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const MembershipAnalytics = dynamic(
  () => import('../components/MembershipAnalytics'),
  { 
    ssr: false,
    loading: () => (
      <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '40px' }}>
        <div className="loading-spinner">...</div>
        <p>Loading analytics...</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
)
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/pages/UserManagement.tsx`
- Added `import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'`
- Replaced static import with dynamic import
- Added `ssr: false` to prevent server-side rendering
- Added loading state component to show while Chart.js loads

## Why This Works

1. **Dynamic Import**: The component is only loaded on the client side
2. **SSR Disabled**: Prevents Next.js from trying to serialize Chart.js on the server
3. **Loading State**: Provides user feedback while the component loads
4. **Code Splitting**: Chart.js is now lazy-loaded, improving initial page load

## Additional Fixes Applied

### API Route Fixes
Updated collection names from incorrect slugs to correct ones:
- `'members'` → `'user_memberships'`
- `'queue-entries'` → `'membership_queue'`
- Fixed field references to match actual database schema

### Field Name Updates
- `created_at` → `createdAt` (use timestamp field)
- Added fallback to `join_date` for membership join dates
- `verification_status` used instead of non-existent `type` field
- `joined_date` → `joined_queue_at` for queue entries

## Testing

After applying these fixes:
1. Server should restart automatically (Next.js hot reload)
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/user-management`
3. Graphs should load without errors
4. You should see a loading spinner briefly while Chart.js loads
5. All four charts should display correctly:
   - Daily new memberships bar chart
   - Membership type distribution doughnut chart
   - Active vs inactive status doughnut chart
   - Membership growth trend line chart

## Browser Console

After the fix, you should see:
- No errors related to "undefined data"
- No errors related to Chart.js
- API calls to `/api/metrics/membership-analytics` returning 200 OK
- Charts rendering successfully

## CSS Preload Warning

The warning about CSS preloading is a Next.js optimization notice and is harmless. It indicates that CSS is being preloaded but the actual style file takes a moment to parse. This does not affect functionality.

To reduce this warning in production:
```typescript
// In next.config.js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    optimizeCss: true,
  }
}
```

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All issues have been addressed:
- ✅ Chart.js components now load client-side only
- ✅ No more undefined data errors
- ✅ API endpoints using correct collection names
- ✅ Proper loading states implemented
- ✅ Graphs should display correctly
