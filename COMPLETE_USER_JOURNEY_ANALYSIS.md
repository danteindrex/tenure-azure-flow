This document provides a comprehensive analysis of what happens when a user completes the entire signup and onboarding process in the Tenure application.

---

## Step-by-Step User Journey

### **Step 1: Email & Password Registration**
**Location**: [SignUp.tsx:20](src/pages/SignUp.tsx#L20)

**What Happens**:
1. User visits `/signup`
2. User provides:
   - Email address
   - Password (with confirmation)
   - Agrees to terms and conditions
3. System creates user account via Better Auth
4. User record created with:
   - `status: 'Pending'`
   - `emailVerified: false`
5. Email verification code sent

**Database State**:
- ‚úÖ User record in `users` table (status: `Pending`)
- ‚ùå No profile yet
- ‚ùå No phone contact
- ‚ùå No subscription

---

### **Step 2: Email Verification**
**Location**: [SignUp.tsx:20](src/pages/SignUp.tsx#L20)

**What Happens**:
1. User receives OTP via email
2. User enters 6-digit verification code
3. System verifies code via Better Auth
4. User's `emailVerified` flag set to `true`

**Database State**:
- ‚úÖ User record (status: `Pending`, emailVerified: `true`)
- ‚ùå No profile yet
- ‚ùå No phone contact
- ‚ùå No subscription

---

### **Step 3: Personal Information & Address**
**Location**: [SignUp.tsx:20](src/pages/SignUp.tsx#L20) & [profiles/upsert.ts](pages/api/profiles/upsert.ts)

**What Happens**:
1. User provides personal information:
   - First name, last name, middle name
   - Date of birth
   - Street address, city, state, zip code, country
2. System calls `/api/profiles/upsert` to save data
3. Creates/updates multiple database records:
   - User profile
   - User address
   - User membership (initialized with `PENDING` status)

**Database State**:
- ‚úÖ User record (status: `Pending`, emailVerified: `true`)
- ‚úÖ User profile in `user_profiles` table
- ‚úÖ User address in `user_addresses` table
- ‚úÖ User membership in `user_memberships` (status: `PENDING`)
- ‚ùå No phone contact yet
- ‚ùå No subscription yet

---

### **Step 4: Phone Verification**
**Location**: [SignUp.tsx:788](src/pages/SignUp.tsx#L788)

**What Happens**:
1. User provides phone number with country code (default: +256 Uganda)
2. System sends OTP via Twilio
3. User enters verification code
4. System verifies OTP with Twilio
5. Phone contact created with `isVerified: true`
6. Onboarding progress updated

**Database State**:
- ‚úÖ User record (status: `Pending`, emailVerified: `true`)
- ‚úÖ User profile
- ‚úÖ User address
- ‚úÖ Phone contact in `user_contacts` (contactType: `phone`, isVerified: `true`)
- ‚úÖ User membership
- ‚ùå No subscription yet

**Development Note**: There's a bypass option in development mode that skips phone verification.

---

### **Step 5: Payment (Stripe Checkout)**
**Location**: [SignUp.tsx:943](src/pages/SignUp.tsx#L943) & [create-checkout.ts](pages/api/subscriptions/create-checkout.ts)

**What Happens**:
1. User clicks "Proceed to Payment"
2. System calls `/api/subscriptions/create-checkout`
3. Checkout API:
   - Ensures user record exists in database
   - Calls external subscription service
   - Creates Stripe checkout session with:
     - Initial setup fee
     - Recurring monthly subscription
     - Success URL: `/dashboard?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
     - Cancel URL: `/signup?canceled=true`
4. User redirected to Stripe hosted checkout page
5. User completes payment with credit card

**Stripe Checkout Configuration**:
- **Line Items**:
  - Setup fee (one-time)
  - Monthly subscription (recurring)
- **Payment Mode**: Subscription with setup fee
- **Metadata**: Contains userId for webhook processing

**Database State** (Before Payment):
- ‚úÖ User record (status: `Pending`)
- ‚úÖ User profile, address, phone, membership
- ‚ùå No subscription yet
- ‚ùå Still cannot access dashboard

---

## üéâ **What Happens After Successful Payment**

### **Stripe Webhook Processing**
**Location**: [webhook.controller.ts](services/subscription-service/src/controllers/webhook.controller.ts) & [stripe.service.ts](services/subscription-service/src/services/stripe.service.ts)

When payment succeeds, Stripe sends a `checkout.session.completed` webhook event.

#### **1. User Status Activation**
**Code**: [stripe.service.ts:141-146](services/subscription-service/src/services/stripe.service.ts#L141-L146)

```sql
UPDATE users
SET status = 'Active', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = $1
```

The user's status changes from `Pending` ‚Üí `Active`

#### **2. Subscription Record Created**
**Code**: [stripe.service.ts:167-183](services/subscription-service/src/services/stripe.service.ts#L167-L183)

Creates entry in `user_subscriptions` table:
- `provider`: 'stripe'
- `provider_subscription_id`: Stripe subscription ID
- `provider_customer_id`: Stripe customer ID
- `status`: 'active'
- `current_period_start`: Subscription start date
- `current_period_end`: Subscription end date

#### **3. Billing Schedule Created**
**Code**: [stripe.service.ts:186-199](services/subscription-service/src/services/stripe.service.ts#L186-L199)

Creates entry in `user_billing_schedules` table:
- `billing_cycle`: 'MONTHLY'
- `next_billing_date`: End of current period
- `amount`: Recurring monthly amount
- `is_active`: true

#### **4. Payment Method Stored**
**Code**: [stripe.service.ts:202-221](services/subscription-service/src/services/stripe.service.ts#L202-L221)

Creates entry in `user_payment_methods` table:
- `method_type`: 'card'
- `is_default`: true
- `metadata`: Contains Stripe payment details

#### **5. Queue Position Assigned**
**Code**: [stripe.service.ts:224-248](services/subscription-service/src/services/stripe.service.ts#L224-L248)

Creates entry in `membership_queue` table:
```sql
INSERT INTO membership_queue (
  user_id,
  queue_position,  -- Auto-incremented to next available position
  joined_queue_at,
  is_eligible,     -- true
  subscription_active,  -- true
  total_months_subscribed,  -- 0 (initial)
  lifetime_payment_total,   -- 0.00 (initial)
  last_payment_date,
  created_at
)
```

**This is critical**: User is now in the membership queue and eligible for future payouts!

#### **6. Payment Transaction Recorded**
Creates payment transaction record for the initial setup fee.

#### **7. Main App Notification** (Optional)
**Code**: [stripe.service.ts:149-164](services/subscription-service/src/services/stripe.service.ts#L149-L164)

Attempts to notify main app via `/api/onboarding/update-progress` that payment completed.

## üö™ **Dashboard Access Granted**

### **Onboarding Status Check**
**Location**: [onboarding.ts:44-142](src/lib/onboarding.ts#L44-L142)

After payment, when user tries to access any page, the system checks:

```typescript
const status = await OnboardingService.getUserOnboardingStatus(userId)

// Check conditions:
if (user.status === 'Active' && status.hasActiveSubscription) {
  status.step = 'dashboard'
  status.canAccessDashboard = true  // ‚Üê USER CAN NOW ACCESS DASHBOARD
  status.nextRoute = '/dashboard'
  status.nextStep = 6 // Completed
}
```

**Conditions for Dashboard Access**:
1. ‚úÖ `user.status === 'Active'` (set by webhook)
2. ‚úÖ `hasActiveSubscription === true` (subscription record exists)

### **Dashboard Features Available**
**Location**: [Dashboard.tsx](src/pages/Dashboard.tsx)

Once on the dashboard, user can see:

## üîÑ **Recurring Payments**

### **Monthly Billing**
After the initial payment, Stripe automatically charges the user monthly based on the subscription:

1. **Automatic Charge**: Stripe charges card on file
2. **Invoice Created**: Stripe creates invoice
3. **Webhook Sent**: `invoice.payment_succeeded` event
4. **System Updates**:
   - `totalMonthsSubscribed` incremented
   - `lifetimePaymentTotal` increased
   - `lastPaymentDate` updated
   - Payment transaction recorded
   - Queue statistics updated

### **Failed Payment Handling**
If monthly payment fails:
- Webhook: `invoice.payment_failed`
- System logs warning
- User notified via email
- Subscription may be marked as `past_due`

---

## üìã **Business Logic After Completion**

### **Queue Eligibility**
**Location**: [business-logic.ts](src/lib/business-logic.ts)

User is now eligible for payout when:
1. ‚úÖ `subscriptionActive === true`
2. ‚úÖ `isEligible === true` (set during queue enrollment)
3. Fund reaches minimum threshold ($100,000)
4. 12+ months since business launch (already passed: Jan 1, 2024)
5. Queue position becomes eligible based on rules

### **Payout Conditions**
From business rules documentation:

**Fund Must Reach**: $100,000 minimum
- Fund grows from monthly subscriptions
- $25/month per member
- Need ~4,000 active members to reach threshold

**Time Must Pass**: 12 months from launch
- Launch: January 1, 2024
- Already satisfied as of current date

**Queue Position Matters**:
- Members selected sequentially by queue position
- Lower queue position = sooner payout eligibility
- New user gets next available position
